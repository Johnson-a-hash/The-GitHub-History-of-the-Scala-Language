# The-GitHub-History-of-the-Scala-Language

Project Description

In this project, will be challenged to read in, clean up, and visualize the real-world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub).
With almost 30k commits and a history spanning over ten years, Scala is a mature programming language. It is a general-purpose programming language that has recently become another prominent language for data scientists.
This is a guided project from DataCamp.

The dataset we will use, which has been previously mined and extracted from GitHub, is comprised of three files:

pulls_2011-2013.csv contains the basic information about the pull requests, and spans from the end of 2011 up to (but not including) 2014.
pulls_2014-2018.csv contains identical information, and spans from 2014 up to 2018.
pull_files.csv contains the files that were modified by each pull request.
